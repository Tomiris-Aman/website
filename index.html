                    <span><h3>Welcome to my world!</h3> <p>I'm Tomiris, an aspiring medical engineer from Kazakhstan living in Austria. Why don't you get to know me? My interests might seem like they're scattered across the universe, but they're the stars I navigate by. Dive in, click on any icon that catches your eye, and let's embark on this journey together. Who knows? You might find we share more in common than you think.</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextBook" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>Reading is my jam, especially when it comes to non-fiction, history, novels & Greek mythology. Some authors I like include Madeline Miller, Hanya Yanagihara & Robert Greene. Oh, and I do indulge in the occasional Ali Hazelwood romance—gotta keep the heart racing somehow!</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextScience" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>I've always been a curious kid, but it wasn't until I had this biology class in year 7 that everything clicked. Learning about the human body, its crazy intricate systems and how they all fit together—it blew my mind. Suddenly, I knew I wanted to be part of something bigger, something that could help people in a real way. So, after binge-watching a ton of sci-fi movies, medical shows and doing some serious soul-searching, I decided: I wanna be a biomedical engineer.</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextCode" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>My first programming language was JavaScript and thanks to the blood, sweat, and tears of 13-year-old Tomi (mostly tears), you're now visiting my website. Over the years of practicing, I’ve picked up some handy skills. For instance, diving deep into the MERN Stack (Though dropping MongoDB for PostgresSQL) for Backend, making strides in Python and attempting to convince VSCode that I'm not a syntax-error-producing robot.</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextAstro" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>My very first choice of career at the ripe old of 11 was a Quantum Astrophysicist, typical I know. I loved learning about the cosmos, where stars and galaxies told tales older than time, still do btw. Although I have found another passion astrophysics will always have a special place in my heart… and Spotify, I hear this week on StarTalk, Neil and Chuck are discussing flapjack galaxies. Won't want to miss that!</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextNail" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>Nail Art is like adding a little flair to life's daily grind. I love doing my friend’s nails, but do take the occasional client. Currently trying to be a trendy influencer on Instagram by posting my work. Drop a follow if you’d like your nails to look just as fabulous!</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextGym" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>Weightlifting and calisthenics is more than just a hobby; it's a testament to what determination and discipline can achieve. Every lift is a conversation between mind and muscle, every drop of sweat a badge of honor. In a few years, hoping to look like Korra and learn to bend all four elements (So far, can only water bend, but even then, maybe creating a whirlpool in a jacuzzi doesn't count)</p></span>
                </div>
                <div id="alternateTextPen" style="display: none;">
                    <span><p>Back in the day, I was a fanfiction machine! Thats when i discovered my love for writing, I did grow out of it and these days, I've traded in fictional tales for thought-provoking essays. If there's a topic I want to wrap my head around, you bet I'm hitting the books and penning down my thoughts. Sure, it's a labor of love, but there's something incredibly satisfying about putting thoughts to paper. Who knows, maybe one day you'll see my name on the cover of a book...</p></span>
